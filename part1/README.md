# 1D Array Basic Operation
Write a C program that declare an integer array length of one hundred(100) (do not initialize the array).
Then write teh following program. Check Overflow on each program [NB: Don't use Function & Pointer] [Write each program in a different file. 
FIle name will be the problem number]
1. Scan N (take input N from user) values from user into an array.
2. Scan Values From user into an array unitl end of file.
3. Scan values from user into an array untin user input is 0(Zero).

Write a C program that declare and integer array length of one hundred (100) and initialize the array with ten (10) values. Then do the followint operations. [NB: Don't use Function & Pointer] [Write each program in a differenrt file. FIle Name will be teh problem number.]

4. Print entire array each element in newline.
5. Print entire array each element seperated by space.
6. Print entire array each element seperated by comma.
